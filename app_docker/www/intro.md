# Welcome <img style="float: right;" src="FreesearchR-logo.png">

This is the ***FreesearchR*** data analysis tool. We intend ***FreesearchR*** to be a free tool for easy data evaluation and analysis. If you need more advanced tools, start with ***FreesearchR*** and then you'll probably be better off using *R* or similar directly.

Here is a brief summary of the functions:

1.  **Import data** from a spreadsheet/file on your machine, direct export from a REDCap server, sample data or data from a your local environment if run locally.

1.  **Data inspection** and  **modification** like modifying variables or creating new (categorical from numeric or time data, or completely new variables from the data)

1.  **Evaluate data** using descriptive analyses methods and inspect cross-correlations

1.  **Create and export simple, clean plots** for data overview and insights

1.  **Create regression simple models** for even more advanced data analyses

    -   Linear, dichotomous or ordinal logistic regression will be used depending on specified outcome variable
    
    -   Plot regression analysis coefficients

    -   Evaluate model assumptions

1.  **Export results**

    -   Descriptive and regression analyses results for MS Word or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
    
    -   Modified data with preserved metadata
    
    -   Code to recreate all steps locally
