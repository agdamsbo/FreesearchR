# Welcome <img src="FreesearchR-logo.png" style="float: right;"/>

This is the ***FreesearchR*** data analysis tool, a free tool for basic data evaluation and analysis. If you need more advanced tools, start with ***FreesearchR*** and then you'll probably be better off using *R* or similar directly.

The ***FreesearchR*** app should be available to as many people as possible, and the interface can be translated to any language. If you have suggestions or want to help translate, please reach out on [info@freesearchr.org](mailto:info@freesearchr.org).

With this tool you can:

1.  **Import data** from a spreadsheet/file on your machine, directly from a [REDCap](https://projectredcap.org/ "Read more on the data capture tool REDCap") server, try it with sample data or access data directly [if run in R locally](https://agdamsbo.github.io/FreesearchR//#run-locally-on-your-own-machine "Read about running FreesearchR on your local machine")

2.  **Prepare** data for analysis by filtering data, modifying variables or create new variables

3.  **Evaluate data** using descriptive analyses methods and inspect cross-correlations as well as [missing observations](https://agdamsbo.github.io/FreesearchR/articles/missingness.html "Read more about missing data")

4.  **Visualise data** by [creating simple, clean plots](https://agdamsbo.github.io/FreesearchR/articles/visuals.html "See available plot types") for overview and quick insights

5.  **Create simple regression models** for even more advanced data analyses

6.  **Download** results as a report, get the modified data set and save the code for learning and to reproduce the results later

The full [project documentation is here](https://agdamsbo.github.io/FreesearchR/) where you'll find detailed descriptions of the app and link to the source code! If you want to [share feedback, please follow this link to a simple survey](https://redcap.au.dk/surveys/?s=JPCLPTXYDKFA8DA8).
