# Basic visualisations

The goal of ***FreesearchR*** is to keep things simple. Visuals can get very complicated. We provide a selection of plots, that helps visualise typical clinical and will be enough for most use cases, and for publishing to most journals.

If you want to go further, have a look at these sites with suggestions and sample code for data plotting:
