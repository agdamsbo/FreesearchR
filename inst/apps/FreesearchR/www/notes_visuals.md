This section on plotting data is kept very minimal, and includes only the most common plot types for clinical projects.

If you want to go further, have a look at these sites with suggestions and sample code for data plotting:

-   [*R* Charts](https://r-charts.com/): Extensive gallery with great plots

-   [*R* Graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/): Another gallery with great graphs

-   [grphics principles](https://graphicsprinciples.github.io/): Easy to follow recommendations for clear visuals.
