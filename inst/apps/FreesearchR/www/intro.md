# Welcome

This is the ***FreesearchR*** data analysis tool. We intend the ***FreesearchR*** to be a powerful and free tool for easy data evaluation and analysis at the hands of the clinician. If you need more advanced tools for regression models or plotting, you'll probably be better off using *R* or similar directly on your own machine.

By intention, this tool has been designed to be simple to use with a minimum of mandatory options to keep the workflow streamlined, while also including a few options to go even further.

There are some simple steps to go through (see corresponding tabs in the top):

1.  Import data (a spreadsheet/file on your machine, direct export from a REDCap server, or a local file provided with a package) to get started.

1.  Data inspection and  modification (change variable classes, create new variables (categorical from numeric or time data, or completely new variables from the data)

1.  Evaluate data using descriptive analyses methods and inspect cross-correlations

1.  Create simple, clean plots for data overview.

1.  Create regression models for even more advanced data analyses

    -   Linear, dichotomous or ordinal logistic regression will be used depending on specified outcome variable
    
    -   Plot regression analysis coefficients

    -   Evaluation of model assumptions

1.  Export the the analyses results for MS Word or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) as well as the data with preserved metadata.
