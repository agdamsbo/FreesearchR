This is the ***freesearchR*** web data analysis tool. The ***freesearchR*** is an opinioated tool for easy data evaluation and analysis at the hands of the clinician. We intend it to be a powerful to, that is easy and secure to use.

By intention, this tool has been designed to be simple to use with a minimum of mandatory options to keep the workflow streamlined, while also including a few options to go even further.

There are four simple steps to go through:

1.  Import data (this can be a spreadsheet on your machine or direct export from a REDCap server)

2.  A *optional* step of data modification (change variable classes and creating categorical variables (factors) from numeric or time data)

3.  Data analysis of cross-sectionally designed studies

    -   Classic baseline charactieristics (options to stratify and compare variables)

    -   Linear, dichotomous or ordinal logistic regression will be used depending on specified outcome variable

    -   Evaluation of model assumptions

4.  Export the the analyses results as .docx or .odt.
