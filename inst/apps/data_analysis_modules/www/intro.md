# Welcome

This is the ***freesearcheR*** web data analysis tool. We intend the ***freesearcheR*** to be a powerful and free tool for easy data evaluation and analysis at the hands of the clinician.

By intention, this tool has been designed to be simple to use with a minimum of mandatory options to keep the workflow streamlined, while also including a few options to go even further.

There are four simple steps to go through (see corresponding tabs in the top):

1.  Import data (a spreadsheet/file on your machine, direct export from a REDCap server, or a local file provided with a package) to get started.

2.  An *optional* step of data modification (change variable classes and creating categorical variables (factors) from numeric or time data)

3.  Data analysis of cross-sectionally designed studies (more study designs are planned to be included)

    -   Classic baseline charactieristics (options to stratify and compare variables)

    -   Linear, dichotomous or ordinal logistic regression will be used depending on specified outcome variable

    -   Evaluation of model assumptions

4.  Export the the analyses results for MS Word or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) as well as the data with preserved metadata.

Have a look at the [documentations page]() for further project description. If you're interested in the source code, then go on, [have a look](https://github.com/agdamsbo/freesearcheR)!

If you encounter anything strange or the app doesn't act as expected. Please [report on Github](https://github.com/agdamsbo/freesearcheR/issues).
