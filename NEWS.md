# freesearcheR 25.2.1

First steps towards a more focused and simplified interface.

Focus will be on ease of use, handling basic functionality for data inspection and descriptive analyses.

Inspired by the Stroke Center implementation guidelines of the WSO, we will apply a similar approach to this project in order to keep the interface simple and robust. Basic functions for descriptive analyses and data browsing are the basics. More advanced features like regression analyses are added for learning purposes, but really should be done by one self in software like *R* to ensure learning and reproducibility.

Teal dependencies removed. The teal framework really seems very powerful and promising, but it will also mean less control and more clutter. May come up again later.

All main components have been implemented.

Next steps are:

-   Polished code export

-   Improved workflow and thorough step-wise guide/documentation

-   Implement in clinical projects

-   Implement in data analysis courses

-   Extensive testing and bug squashing
