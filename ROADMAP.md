# Project roadmap

The current state of the app is considered experimental, however, from version 25.4.2, the ***FreesearchR*** app is considered functional and can be used for data evaluation and analyses.

Below are some (the actual list is quite long and growing) of the planned new features and improvements:

### Implementation in real world clinical studies and projects

This really is the main goal of the whole project.

### New features:

-   [ ] Merge data from multiple sources (you can merge sheets from a workbook (xls or ods), but this would allow merging several files and/or REDcap data)

-   [ ] Additional plot types (bar plots, *others...*)

-   [ ] Missingness analysis panel

### Expanded options for regression models:

Expansion of the regression analysis functionality have been put on hold for now to focus on the more basic use-cases):

More study designs

-   [x] Cross-sectional data analyses

-   [ ] Longitudinal data analyses

-   [ ] Survival analysis

Other regression models

-   [ ] Stratified analyses
    
-   [ ] Mixed models of repeated measures
    
-   [ ] Cox regression analyses

Data handling

-   [ ] Transforming data (transpose and pivoting)

### Improved documentation:

-   [ ] Video walk-through of central functions
