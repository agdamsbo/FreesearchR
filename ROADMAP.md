# Project roadmap

The current state of the app is considered experimental, and a lot of things are still changing. It is, however, in a usable state, with basic functions available to the user.

Below are some (the actual list is quite long and growing) of the planned features and improvements:

-   [ ] Stratified analyses

-   Additional study designs:

    -   [x] Cross-sectional data analyses

    -   [ ] Longitudinal data analyses

    -   [ ] Survival analysis

-   More detailed variable browser

    -   [x] Add histograms for data distribution. 2025-01-16

    -   [x] Option to edit labels. 2025-01-16
    
-   More output controls

    -   [ ] Theming output tables

    -   [ ] Select analyses to include in report

-   [x] Export modified data. 2025-01-16

-   [ ] Include reproducible code for all steps (maybe not all, but most steps, and the final dataset can be exported)

-   [x] ~~Modify factor levels~~ Factor level modifications is possible through converting factors to numeric > cutting numeric with desired fixed values. 2024-12-12

-   [x] More options for date/datetime/time grouping/factoring. Included weekday and month-only options. 2024-12-12
