# Project roadmap

The current state of the app is considered experimental, and a lot of things are still changing. It is, however, in a usable state, with basic functions available to the user.

Below are some (the actual list is quite long and growing) of the planned features and improvements:

-   Additional study designs in regression models (expansion of the regression analysis functionality have been put on hold for now to focus on the more basic use-cases):

    -   [x] Cross-sectional data analyses

    -   [ ] Longitudinal data analyses

    -   [ ] Survival analysis
    
    -   [ ] Stratified analyses

-   More detailed variable browser

    -   [x] Add histograms for data distribution. 2025-01-16

    -   [x] Option to edit labels. 2025-01-16
    
-   More output controls

    -   [x] ~~Theming output tables~~ The "JAMA" theme is the new standard.

    -   [x] ~~Select analyses to include in report.~~ Includes characteristics table and regression table if present. No other analyses are intended for the report as of now.

-   [x] Export modified data. 2025-01-16

-   [x] Include reproducible code for all steps (maybe not all, but most steps, and the final dataset can be exported) 2025-04-10

-   [x] ~~Modify factor levels~~ Factor level modifications is possible through converting factors to numeric > cutting numeric with desired fixed values. 2024-12-12

-   [x] More options for date/datetime/time grouping/factoring. Included weekday and month-only options. 2024-12-12

-   Graphs and plots

    - [x] Correlation matrix plot for data exploration 2025-2-20
    
    - [x] Grotta bars for ordianl outcomes (and sankey) 2025-3-17
    
    - [x] Coefficient plotting for regression analyses (forest plot) 2025-2-20

Documentation:

-   [ ] Complete getting started page describing all functionality.

-   [ ] Streamlined functions documentation

New features:

-   [ ] Merge data from multiple sources (this would in itself be a great feature, but not of highest importance)

-   [ ] Additional plot types (missingness, *others...*)
